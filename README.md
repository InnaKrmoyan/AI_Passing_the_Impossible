# AI_Passing_the_Impossible
The code that is contained in the file `workInProgress.ipynb` is responsible for the world definition from the perspective of the game (full definition) and the player (the known information + information obtained from the percepts)

Additional functionality is implemented that makes the game playable for the player. (The said functionality is a bit cursed and not fully complete.) 

Some functions that return suggested solutions are also implemented, but some calculations that were included in the paper were done "by hand". This means that we used the file `world generation.ipynb` to generate game states and checked if the said algorithm succeeded in that world or not.
